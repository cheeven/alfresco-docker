# Alfresco in Docker

Build files to set up and run Alfresco Community Servers in a Docker environment.

I only work on 3 separate versions as those are used in my current company.

## Pre-requisite

* Docker toolbox if you are working on a development machine.
* Docker machine configured with over 4GB memory and 60GB disk space.
